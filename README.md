# Our Default Github Issues Workflow

This repository is a template for our default Github issues workflow in Praqma.
We use the workflow for our Github repositories that uses Githubs issues.

It is simple, it is easy to use and it uses some simple conventions and are only structures around labels and optionally a Kanban board on top from [waffle.io](https://waffle.io).
